\title{Determine Potential Tag Detachment Based on Activity Threshold}
\usage{
tag_fell_off(data, vedba_threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with tracking data that must include \code{tag_id}, \code{timestamp}, and \code{vpm} (VeDBA per minute) columns.}

\item{vedba_threshold}{A numeric value representing the threshold below which a tag is considered potentially detached.}
}
\value{
The input data frame with an additional logical column \code{tag_fell_off} indicating whether the tag
is considered to have potentially fallen off.
}
\description{
This function assesses tracking data for each unique tag ID to determine potential detachment
events, based on a specified threshold for minimum activity levels (e.g., VeDBA).
