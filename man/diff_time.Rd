\title{Calculate Differential VeDBA and Time Between Sequential Points}
\usage{
diff_time(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with tracking data that must include \code{tag_id}, \code{timestamp}, and \code{total_vedba} columns.}
}
\value{
The input data frame with additional columns \code{diff_vedba} for the VeDBA difference and
\code{diff_time} for the time difference in minutes between each record and its successor.
}
\description{
This function iterates through tracking data for each unique tag ID, calculating the difference
in VeDBA (vectorial dynamic body acceleration) between sequential records and the time difference
between these records.
